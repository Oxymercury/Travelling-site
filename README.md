## Description

This is my first project developed with the help of React JS. The site features scroll animations using the AOS library, state management with `useState`, and lifecycle methods with `useEffect`. The design was inspired by a project from a YouTube channel, but it has been recreated using React JS and Tailwind CSS instead of plain CSS and JS.
